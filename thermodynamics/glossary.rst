.. _extensive_quantity:

Extensive quantity
    Its magnitude is additive for subsystems,
    e.g. volume, entropy, number of moles, displacement, induction, strain.

.. _intensive_quantity:

Intensive quantity
    Its magnitude is independent of the size of the system,
    e.g. temperature, pressure, chemical potential, electric field,
    magnetic field, stress

.. _conjugate_quantity:

Conjugate quantities
    A pair of variables that their product has the dimension of energy
    or energy per unit volume, e.g. temperature and entropy, pressure and volume.

    See the `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables_(thermodynamics)>`_.
